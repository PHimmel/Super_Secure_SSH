# Super_Secure_SSH
An additional layer of protection for your remote devices.
Easy to install.

## Basic info
This is to create an extra layer of security for SSH logins.

Add your unique password and number of attempts to this file (default is 3).
Save it, then enter `python3 ssh_verification.py` onto
the final line of `~/.bashrc`.

Now everytime you login you will have a second layer of protection.
